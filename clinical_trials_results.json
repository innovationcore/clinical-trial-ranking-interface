To centrally test resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for genetic mutations to facilitate accrual to randomized adjuvant studies.\n\nII. To obtain clinically annotated tumor tissue and patient-matched non-malignant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from peripheral blood, as well as detailed epidemiologic and clinical follow-up data, to allow clinically annotated advanced genomic analyses in concert with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the natural history of molecularly characterized NSCLC to allow subsequent development of targeted therapies against genotype-defined subpopulations in the adjuvant and recurrent settings.\n\nII. To cross-validate local genotyping assays for EGFR and ALK and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a central reference standard, when available.\n\nEXPLORATORY/OTHER OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To study the genomic evolution of lung cancers by comparing genomic characteristics at resection and at recurrence.\n\nII. To understand reasons behind lack of enrollment to adjuvant targeted therapy studies for potentially eligible patients.\n\nIII. To study the clinical significance of circulating tumor DNA within the plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from early stage lung cancer patients.\n\nIV. To perform proteomic analyses on lung cancer specimens obtained at the time of resection (to identify prognostic biomarkers).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSTEP 1 (SCREENING): Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for EGFR, ALK, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) testing via direct sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The first is gadolinium, also known as \"contrast,\" which is typically injected into a vein during a MRI scan. The second part is a nanoparticle (linked to the gadolinium) that may make focused radiation work more effectively.

The study is planning to recruit tentatively 33-66 subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors in phase I and approximately 42-120 subjects with EGFR mutant and/or cMET aberrated NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard treatment(s) (including platinum-based therapy) will be enrolled at the RP2D(s) in phase II part of the study. In phase II, patients will be assigned to five groups according to their molecular status at baseline. The trial will consist of molecular pre-screening period (Phase II only), clinical screening period (-28 to -1 days), treatment cycles (each cycle is 28 days, maximum up to 2 years), and safety follow-up period (30 days after the last dose).",

        "brief_summary": "Dynamic digital radiography (DDR) is a new advanced version of chest radiography that captures dynamic images at a rate of 15 frames per second. It is coupled with an analytical software that allows it to provide more advanced measures of lung motion, ventilation, and perfusion compared to traditional chest radiography. While implementation of DDR fixed machines are beginning elsewhere in the US, this trial involves the first applications of an FDA-approved portable DDR machine, for use at the bedside in the ICU.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to determine the feasibility and safety of portable DDR technology in the ICU, as well as to evaluate the improved clinical diagnostic value of the portable DDR system over current standards of care.\n\nParticipants will receive one to three sets of DDR images, which will then be compared to their clinical gold standard exams (such as chest x-rays, CTs, or VQ scans) to assess and improve the precision and accuracy of measurements such as diaphragmatic motion, lung movement, and perfusion.",
        "detailed_description": "Chest radiography was introduced to medical practice over a century ago, shortly after the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen. Since then, it has been a key component of the health, screening, clinical evaluation, and the assessments of therapy for billions of people. To this day, chest radiography remains the most frequently ordered imaging test. In this 700-bed tertiary care hospital, over 100,000 chest radiographs are obtained annually. The technique of chest radiography has remained largely unchanged and is seen as a mostly qualitative rather than quantitative tool. Chest dynamic X-ray (DDR) is a new advanced version of chest radiography that provides important quantitative parameters such as lung motion, ventilation, and perfusion. With a dynamic scan of 20-30 seconds, sequential images of both lungs are obtained with high temporal resolution during breathing (7.5-30 frames per second), without increasing radiation dose. DDR utilizes a dynamic digital radiography (DDR) technique with a flat-panel detector (2-6) and generates images with a field-of-view (FOV) that can cover both lungs. DDR utilizes detectors with higher sensitivity than those typically used in conventional radiography, enabling multiple dynamic time frames to be obtained despite keeping the dose mostly unchanged. Compared to conventional radiography, computer analysis and image processing of the DDR sequential time frames provide additional valuable metrics that capture motion and other key functions of the lungs, while high-quality chest radiographs can also be generated from the recombined frames. Chest DDR can be performed in essentially any patient position, including standing or sitting, to capture lung physiology in a manner representative of daily life. Furthermore, DDR is inexpensive, requires minimal space, and enables high throughput, which can help reduce medical costs. While area-detector CT can provide a higher temporal resolution, its FOV cannot entirely cover both lungs and its radiation dose can be prohibitively high. Chest DDR offers a unique opportunity to provide dynamic imaging parameters for lung motion and function in a safe, practical, and cost-effective manner.\n\nRecently, the portable DDR technology has become available. This portable DDR scanner enables applications for non-mobile patients, like ICU patients. It allows the semi-quantitative or quantitative evaluation of pulmonary perfusion, ventilation, and diaphragmatic motion. ICU patients may have limited access to CT or MRI scanners due to the severity of their condition and/or to difficulties associated with support their devices (ECMO, LVAD, etc.), hence, why the portable DDR technology could have an especially meaningful impact on their care. The current Radiology team consists of Drs. Nishino, Wada, Valtchinov and Madore. The PI's group from Radiology will work in close collaboration with Dr. Frendl's research team in the BWH ICUs, as well as their biostatistician as multidisciplinary team of experts. They will also continue cooperation with Mr. Tsunomori and Mr. Yoneyama. These team members already have an established track record of successful collaboration with the PI.\n\nThe investigators will use the observational study design where two diagnostic imaging modalities will be compared for their ability to best diagnose lung pathologies (i.e., diaphragmatic motion and lung aeration/ventilation, pulmonary perfusion, and lung water content). These imaging modalities are: (i) the current portable AP chest x-ray (CXR)-based diagnostic technique and (ii) the recently developed portable dynamic chest XR (DDR) technique.\n\nThe DDR technology has yet to be proven to provide specific benefits for the care of the patients through the improved diagnosis of their pulmonary issues. Its ability to provide clinically meaningful additional information on aspects of lung pathologies (diaphragmatic motion and lung aeration/ventilation, pulmonary perfusion, and lung water content), that cannot be clearly discerned from the current portable CXR-based diagnostic technique, need to be documented; hence, the aims.\n\nThis study design will compare the ability to diagnose those lung pathologies (atelectasis, pulmonary embolus, and pulmonary edema) as determined by either the DDR technology or the traditional qualitative portable routine AP CXR (the current standards of diagnosis) through images obtained via the two techniques at the same time points for each patient. The DDR imaging and analysis will provide both qualitative and semi-quantitative data for each patient at all time points.\n\nFor this study, the patient's routine portable CXR will serve as the control image when applicable, and DDR images will serve as study images for each timepoint. For certain clinical conditions, the applicable gold standards will be used as controls, i.e. CT angiogram for pulmonary embolus, V-Q scans for lung ventilation and perfusion, and fluorographic swallowing studies for speech and swallow evaluation.\n\nData derived from these studies will be expected to provide novel and clinically crucial (quantitative or semi-quantitative) information on the degree of diaphragmatic excursion when the patient is spontaneously ventilating vs. when ventilator support is provided. This would be crucial for decision making regarding the patient's readiness for extubation, or, inversely, when poor excursion of the diaphragms is detected for non-ventilated patients, it would support the decision for early implementation of ventilator support. Data on lung aeration would also factor into this decision-making process.\n\nCurrently, quantitative or semi-quantitative data regarding these physiologic functions of the lungs are not available. Hence, why the investigators will focus on validating these novel metrics against clinical scenarios and outcomes. The investigators anticipate that this novel technology will better guide clinical decision making like the need for (or inversely, the safe removal of) ongoing ventilator support for our patients.\n\nFurthermore, the perfusion (blood flow assessment) component of the image analysis would provide invaluable (currently unavailable) diagnostic options for those patients for whom CT angiogram is not available to rule out/confirm pulmonary embolism (PE). CT angiogram is not available for patients who suffer from hemodynamic instability, or when it is clinically contraindicated, like patients with impending renal failure. The added value of the DDR technology for the diagnosis of larger PEs will be assessed in the later stages of this study.",

        "brief_summary": "This study intends to explore feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes related to the use of a digital health coaching intervention for individuals who have completed primary therapy for cancer. Up to 625 individuals with diverse cancer diagnoses will be enrolled across up to 8 clinical sites to participate in a randomized wait-list control study. Those in the intervention group will receive 6 months of digital coaching up front followed by 6 months of ongoing monitoring via patient reported and clinical outcomes, as well as wearable data. Those in the control group will be monitored via patient reported and clinical outcomes as well as wearable data for the first 6 months followed by 6 months of digital health coaching. Both groups will collect fecal microbiome samples at enrollment and month 6. The study aims to explore if and how digital health coaching may be used to enhance outcomes for individuals following completion of primary cancer therapy.",
        "detailed_description": "Background: There are an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States, accounting for approximately 5% of the entire US population, and this number is anticipated to increase by 31% over the next 10 years to include 22.2 million individuals.1 Due to advances in therapy individuals with cancer are experiencing increased overall survival that is often accompanied by the management of cancer as a chronic condition.2 As such many individuals require maintenance therapies that extend for months or years beyond the completion of primary therapy with surgery, radiation, and/or pharmacologic therapies. Chronic management of cancer care may include both long-term maintenance therapy as well as the management of treatment-related sequelae, the majority of which occurs beyond the clinical setting. Supportive care needs include symptom support, general wellness, and a focus on the importance of adherence to treatment and follow-up, all of which may influence quality and quantity of life. Accordingly, there is a critical and growing need for comprehensive, accessible platforms to support survivor self-management of symptoms and general wellness (including physical, functional, and psychosocial well-being and healthcare adherence). There is furthermore a critical knowledge gap on the correlation between individual symptoms and wellness on novel biomarkers, specifically intestinal (gut) microbiome. Gut microbiome regulates critical physiological processes-digestion, mood, and overall immune health, but to date studies have focused on dysbiosis during cancer treatment. The investigators seek to explore dynamics of gut microbiota after cancer treatment and understand how health behavioral changes prompted by health coaching to modulate symptoms and physical/ psychosocial well-being may also positively influence the restoration of gut flora.\n\nAims: The objective of this randomized, wait-list control study is to assess the effect of a 6-month digital health coaching program in cancer survivors within 1 year of primary treatment and longitudinally measure its impact on multifaceted health outcomes. The investigators aim to: 1) Primarily, assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of digital health coaching on participants' health self-efficacy; 2) Secondarily, characterize associations between participant symptoms, physical/psychosocial well-being, and health self-management and gut microbiota changes; and 3) Explore patient-generated health data outcomes among participants (patient-reported \\[PROs\\] and wearable biometrics outcomes).\n\nMethods: The proposed study will utilize a randomized-wait list control design to enroll up to 625 individuals with diverse tumor types who have completed primary treatment and are within 1 year of diagnosis. Each of up to 8 collaborating sites will enroll up to 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in a 6-month digital health coaching program that combines person-to-person calls once weekly, accompanied by up to 4 digital nudges of evidence-based content via text, email and/or mobile application, based on the participant's preference. Content will focus on key topics designed to optimize survivorship outcomes, including management of late and long-term effects of therapy, diet and exercise, fatigue, financial toxicity, and other associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, depression), medication adherence, surveillance, and managing anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence. The program emphasizes targeting modifiable behaviors that can improve quality of life and health outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival. Those randomized to the intervention group will receive the 6-month coaching intervention up front followed by 6 months of on-going clinical, patient reported, activity, and microbiome data collection. Those randomized to the control will receive 6-months of clinical, patient reported, activity, and microbiome data collection, after which they will be randomized to the digital health coaching intervention.\n\nOutcome Measures: All participants will be followed for 12-months during which time they will be provided with Fitbit devices to track engagement in physical activity. Microbiome samples will be collected at enrollment and 6 months to explore biomarkers of inflammation, which will be analyzed to examine associations between microbiota signatures and engagement in physical activity and PROs. Genomic bacterial DNA will be extracted and analyzed for any taxonomic changes in the microbiota diversity and composition with 16s rRNA sequencing. Microbiome analysis will be conducted in partnership with The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). PROs will be collected at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 to track progress during and following the program and to provide insights into the experience of quality of life, symptom burden, mental health, cognitive function, sleep quality, sexual health, and financial toxicity.\n\nRationale: This program seeks to address survivors' total well-being, including co-morbid conditions, psychosocial wellness, and healthy lifestyle behaviors, to enhance outcomes for individuals who have completed primary therapy for a cancer diagnosis. The approach is innovative in exploring how digital health coaching may be used to support the holistic needs of cancer survivors beyond the clinical care setting. The robust collection of patient-reported, wearable, biomarker, and clinical data, as well as qualitative data related to patient priorities, concerns and challenges in the context of Health Coaching, will allow for triangulation of data to comprehensively inform the experience of individuals following primary therapy as they manage their health in the community setting.",

        "brief_summary": "This is a First-in-Human Phase IA/IB/II open label dose escalation study of intravenous (IV) administration of ONC-392, a humanized anti-CTLA4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, as single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and non-small cell lung cancers.",
        "detailed_description": "Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), also known as CD152 (cluster of differentiation 152), is a cell surface protein receptor that interacts with B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) to ensure proper function of regulatory T cells and protect host against autoinflammatory diseases. Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated strong and broad cancer immunotherapeutic effects (CITE) in a variety of preclinical models and are used clinically both as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with Nivolumab (anti-PD-1). However, CTLA-4 monotherapy has more immunotherapy-related adverse effects (irAEs) than anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. In addition, the rate of severe irAE (Grades 3 and 4) reached 55% in melanoma patients receiving combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. The strong irAEs further limit the doses tolerated by cancer patients. Nevertheless, combination with anti-PD-1 resulted in significantly improved response rates and patient survival in multiple types of cancer. Furthermore, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies induce long-lasting immunity in cancer patients. Therefore, CTLA-4 remains an important immunotherapy target, but major challenges remain in improving both safety and efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.\n\nONC-392 is a highly selective, humanized monoclonal IgG1-kappa isotype antibody against CTLA-4. The parental clone was identified through in vivo screening in humanized CTLA-4 mouse model for high anti-tumor efficacy and low autoimmune toxicity. We have recently demonstrated that ONC-392 is dissociation from CTLA-4 under low pH to allow its escape from lysosomal degradation and recycle to cell surface. We have provided several lines of evidence for the notion that a pH-sensitive antibody ONC-392 is not only safer but also more effective in Treg depletion and tumor rejection than the Ipilimumab, which is pH-insensitive. First, by preserving CTLA-4 on the cell surface, Onc-392 leaves higher ligand density for better ADCC.\n\nSecond, Onc-392 is more efficient in Treg depletion in tumor microenvironment. Third, Onc-392 is significantly more potent in inducing rejection of large tumors.\n\nThe study consists of four parts:\n\n(1) The Part A study is a dose-finding rapid titration, Phase I trial of ONC-392 as a single agent in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with various histology. The aim of this trial is to define the recommended Phase II dose for ONC-392 monotherapy (RP2D-M). (2) The Part B study is a dose-finding phase with ONC-392 in combination with a standard dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.\n\n(3) The Part C consists of different expansion arms.\n\n1. Arm A: Pancreatic Cancer Cohort, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have progressive disease after first and second lines of systemic treatment.\n2. Arm B: TNBC Cohort, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic TNBC patients who have progressive disease after prior systemic treatments, including checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.\n3. Arm C: NSCLC Mono Cohort 1, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR or ALK mutations who have progressive disease after prior systemic treatments, including targeted therapy or checkpoint inhibitors.\n4.

Arm E: NSCLC IO R/R Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic NSCLC cancer patients who are R/R to prior anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status.\n6.

Adult female TSC patients may also enroll, with or without lung cysts.",
        "detailed_description": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an uncommon disease affecting women. It is associated with cystic lung destruction and progressive respiratory failure. The Multicenter International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial, led by the investigators' research team, demonstrated that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition with sirolimus was an effective therapy that stabilized decline in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume). However, lung function decline resumed when the drug was stopped at the one year point in MILES, suggesting that therapy is suppressive rather than remission-inducing, and may need to be lifelong. There is therefore a need to understand whether long-term therapy with sirolimus is safe and effective. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will conduct the Multicenter International Durability and Safety of Sirolimus in LAM Trial (MIDAS). This is an observational, real world registry. The investigators propose to enroll 600 LAM patients who are on, have previously failed or been intolerant of or are considering taking sirolimus or everolimus for clinical reasons in a longitudinal observational study. This registry will follow lung function tests and adverse events that are obtained for clinical purposes over periods of at least 2 years. The decision to treat with mTOR inhibitor therapy is made by the clinician and the patient, and will be managed by the participant's clinician. This study will help us to refine treatment for patients with LAM and determine if long term suppressive therapy with sirolimus can prevent progression to later stages of disease. This research will be accomplished as part of the NIH/NCATS Rare Lung Disease Consortium, with data stored and analyzed by the Database Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida.",

        "brief_summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery to standard of care memantine and whole brain radiation therapy that avoids the hippocampus (the memory zone of the brain) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Whole brain radiation therapy delivers a low dose of radiation to the entire brain including the normal brain tissue. Hippocampal avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to the hippocampus which is a brain structure that is important for memory. The drug, memantine, is also often given with whole brain radiotherapy because it may decrease the risk of side effects related to thinking and memory. Stereotactic radiosurgery may decrease side effects related to memory and thinking compared to standard of care HA-WBRT plus memantine.",

Determine whether SRS relative to HA-WBRT plus memantine for brain metastases from SCLC preserves cognitive function as separately measured by the HVLT-R, COWA, TMT Parts A and B, and Clinical Trial Battery Composite (CTB COMP).\n\nII. Assess perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) after SRS relative to HA-WBRT plus memantine for brain metastases from SCLC.\n\nIII.

Lesion volume will be approximated by measuring the lesion's three perpendicular diameters on contrast enhanced, T1-weighted MRI and the product of those diameters will be divided by 2 to estimate the lesion volume (e.g. xyz/2). Alternatively, direct volumetric measurements via slice by slice contouring on a treatment planning software package can be used to calculate the total tumor volume.\n  * Brain metastases must be diagnosed on MRI, which will include the following elements:\n\n    * REQUIRED MRI ELEMENTS\n\n      * Post gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient (SPGR). Acceptable 3D SPGR sequences include magnetization prepared 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), turbo field echo (TFE) MRI, BRAVO (Brain Volume Imaging) or 3D Fast FE (field echo). The T1-weighted 3D scan should use the smallest possible axial slice thickness, not to exceed 1.5 mm.\n      * Pre-contrast T1 weighted imaging (3D imaging sequence strongly encouraged).\n      * A minimum of one axial T2 FLAIR (preferred) or T2 sequence is required.

However, within 21 days prior to enrollment, brain MRI must be repeated to confirm eligibility.\n\n  * Patients with symptomatic brain metastases and/or brain metastases in eloquent locations (e.g., brainstem, pre-/post central gyrus, visual cortex) are eligible for enrollment on the trial; however, the specific treatment approach of starting with systemic therapy alone and delaying brain radiation is not recommended for these patients.\n* Concurrent immunotherapy with brain radiation (SRS or HA-WBRT) is permitted.\n* Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential) within 14 days prior to registration. Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must use contraception while on study.\n* Patients may have had prior intracranial surgical resection. Patients must have completed prior intracranial surgical resection at least 14 days prior to registration.\n* Because neurocognitive testing is the primary goal of this study, patients must be proficient in English or French Canadian.\n* The patient must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.\n\n  * Patients with impaired decision-making capacity are not permitted on study.\n* ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA PRIOR TO STEP 2 REGISTRATION\n* The following baseline neurocognitive tests must be completed within 21 days prior to Step 2 registration: HVLT-R, TMT, and COWA. The neurocognitive test will be uploaded into RAVE for evaluation by Dr. Wefel. Once the upload is complete, within 3 business days a notification will be sent via email to the RA to proceed to Step 2.\n\n  * NOTE: Completed baseline neurocognitive tests can be uploaded at the time of Step 1 registration.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Planned infusion of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the same day as SRS or HA-WBRT treatment. Patients may have had prior chemotherapy. Concurrent immunotherapy is permitted.\n* Prior allergic reaction to memantine.\n* Intractable seizures while on adequate anticonvulsant therapy; more than 1 seizure per month for the past 2 months.\n* Patients with definitive leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Known history of demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis.\n* Contraindication to MR imaging such as implanted metal devices that are MRI-incompatible, allergy to MRI contrast that cannot be adequately addressed with pre-contrast medications, or foreign bodies that preclude MRI imaging. (Questions regarding MRI compatibility of implanted objects should be reviewed with the Radiology Department performing the MRI).\n* Current use of (other N-methyl-D-aspartate \\[NMDA\\] antagonists) amantadine, ketamine, or dextromethorphan.\n* Radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus or other architectural change of the ventricular system resulting in significant anatomic distortion of the hippocampus, including placement of external ventricular drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt.\n\n  * Mild cases of hydrocephalus not resulting in significant anatomic distortion of the hippocampus are permitted.\n* Prior radiotherapy to the brain, including SRS, WBRT, or prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI).\n* Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration\n  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other acute respiratory illness precluding study therapy at the time of registration\n  * Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects",

        "brief_summary": "This phase II trial compares the usual treatment alone (carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab) to using immunotherapy (atezolizumab) plus the usual treatment in treating patients with peritoneal mesothelioma. The usual treatment consists of surgery or chemotherapy. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Pemetrexed is in a class of medications called antifolate antineoplastic agents. It works by stopping cells from using folic acid to make DNA and may kill cancer cells. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab with usual treatment may work better than usual treatment alone.",

Palbociclib is an oral drug which has been shown to stop the cell cycle, which is the way a cell initiates growth. Gedatolisib is thought to work by controlling a series of events directing cell growth and survival. Gedatolisib may work to stop or slow activity within tumor cells. By putting these two drugs together the investigators hope that it will have a greater effect on cancer growth than either drug alone.",

The phase II part of the study is a randomized controlled trial that tests, for each disease group, the treatment efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with AGuIX gadolinium-chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticles compared to treatment with stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) alone\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Activation and Guidance of Irradiation X (AGuIX) as a treatment for any disease.\n\nAGuIX is a gadolinium-based nanoparticle, gadolinium is the drug used for an MR with contrast.

        "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to test A2B694, an autologous logic-gated Tmod\u2122 CAR T-cell product in subjects with solid tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PANC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer (OVCA), mesothelioma (MESO), and other solid tumors that express MSLN and have lost HLA-A\\*02 expression.\n\nThe main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\nPhase 1: What is the recommended dose of A2B694 that is safe for patients\n\nPhase 2: Does the recommended dose of A2B694 kill the solid tumor cells and protect the patient's healthy cells\n\nParticipants will be required to perform study procedures and assessments, and will also receive the following study treatments:\n\nEnrollment and Apheresis in BASECAMP-1 (NCT04981119)\n\nPreconditioning Lymphodepletion (PCLD) Regimen\n\nA2B694 Tmod CAR T cells at the assigned dose",
        "detailed_description": "This is a seamless phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study that enrolls adults with recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic (considered non-curative) CRC, NSCLC, PANC, OVCA, MESO or other solid tumors with MSLN expression. Subjects must be germline HLA-A\\*02 heterozygous, with tumors that express MSLN and have lost HLA-A\\*02 expression. The purpose of Phase 1 of this study is to determine the safety and the optimal dose of A2B694 (after PCLD) in participants with solid tumor disease. The purpose of Phase 2 of this study is to determine the further safety and efficacy (how well it treats the solid tumor disease) of A2B694.\n\nThe treatment available for these cancers and other solid tumors can be toxic, debilitating, and fatal. In the recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic setting, the intent of standard of care treatment is typically palliative rather than curative, and has not changed significantly in several decades. A2 Bio hypothesizes that A2B694 Tmod CAR T-cell therapy will enable the killing of tumor target cells (those cells that express MSLN and have LOH for HLA-A\\*02 protein). Additionally, normal healthy cells that maintain HLA-A\\*02 expression and co-express MSLN (eg, lung tissue) will not be targeted due to the blocker portion of the Tmod CAR T cell that acts as a self-regulated safety switch that protects normal tissue from damage. A2 Bio believes this will provide a therapeutic safety window compared to previous solid tumor targeting therapies. This hypothesis will be explored in the study.\n\nParticipants for this study must enroll and have their T cells collected (apheresis) in the pre-screening BASECAMP-1 study (NCT04981119). T cells are collected, processed and stored for each participant. Upon disease progression the participant may screen for this study (EVEREST-2) and the participant's T cells are manufactured and then infused following PCLD regimen. There is no time requirement between the studies, and patients may go directly from BASECAMP-1 to EVEREST-2 based on their own disease course.",

        "detailed_description": "Lung cancer is largely tobacco related, but the contribution of inherited susceptibility has been less well-studied, particularly among never-smokers. The goal of this study is to learn more about genetic susceptibility to lung cancer by studying individuals and families with known pathogenic germline mutations and/or family histories suggestive for heritable lung cancer, specifically in cases where tobacco exposure is minimal. Patients will be identified through somatic multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) as well as through reported personal and family histories of one or multiple cancers.\n\nThe overriding goal of this protocol is to follow patients with known germline mutations and strong family histories of lung cancer to better determine their risk of lung cancer and inform a screening paradigm based on this risk. This will allow us to observe the natural history of this disease and better understand the mechanisms underlying lung tumorigenesis in patients with susceptible germline backgrounds. These patients and their families will be enrolled as individuals with or without lung cancer who meet the following criteria: 1) individuals known to carry or at risk for carrying a germline EGFR mutation (T790M or other), identified through family members or by somatic genotyping at diagnosis, 2) individuals known to carry or at risk for carrying a pathogenic germline mutation in genes other than EGFR and with family history of lung cancer, or 3) individuals with no known germline mutation but with minimal exposure to tobacco and family history of lung cancer, personal history of other primary cancers, or multi-focal lung cancer.\n\nThis study is designed to create a data and specimen repository as well as follow patients over time to learn how to better predict lung cancer risk for those with certain genetic changes and family history of lung cancer, and to better understand how and why lung cancer develops in families.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, collection of information from participants' medical record, short questionnaires, and collecting blood and/or saliva samples. Procedures may also include use of tissue samples, access to medical records and stored specimens from deceased relatives, and contact information of family members.\n\nIt is expected that about 500 people will participant in this study.",

Tumor escape can occur for many reasons, but one reason is Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). LOH is the loss of one of the genes that encodes HLA protein. A2 Biotherapeutics, Inc. (A2 Bio) is developing therapies to recognize, target, and kill cancer cells that do not express HLA normally, and minimize any damage to normal cells that express normal HLA.\n\nOnce participants are identified as having LOH on their tumors, apheresis, a procedure to separate and collect white blood cells will be performed. It is the first required step in manufacturing CAR T-cell therapy. The collected T cells will be stored for patients that are likely to benefit from CAR T-cell therapy during their disease care.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nApproximately 1000 participants will be screened for part 1 of the study, including HLA typing, approximately 500 participants will have NGS testing on their tumor samples and be followed for up to 2 years on the study, and up to 200 participants will be screened for part 2 of the study and enrolled if eligible and apheresed and be followed for up to 2 years on the study.\n\nParticipants will be screened (Part 1) for HLA type, and based on results, participants will have archived tumor tissue tested by next generation sequencing (NGS) and be followed for up to 2 years. Based on the tumor NGS results, participants will be apheresed (Part 2) for Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) collection to store their T cells for a future interventional study upon relapse.\n\nEach participant will proceed through the following study periods:\n\n* Screening (Part 1 and 2)\n* Enrollment (Apheresis)\n* Post Apheresis safety follow-up (Day 7)\n* Two-year long term follow-up",

The two most common treatments today are low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and direct anticoagulants (DOACs), in which each has limitations. DOACs are administered orally and are seen as a more convenient alternative though associated with bleeding risk; further, some cancer patients have difficulty swallowing or develop vomiting which leads to unpredictable pharmacodynamic effects with oral therapy. The ANT-007 study will compare treatment with abelacimab monthly administration to apixaban twice daily administration over a 6-month treatment. The study outcomes include VTE recurrence, bleeding event and treatment discontinuation at 6 months",
